# Introduce yourself, your academic and professional background.
# What excites you about the software industry and your passion. At least 80 words
summary: I am a graduate from Queen's University in Kingston, Ontario, with a Bachelor of Computing (Honours) with a specialization in Software Design.
My years in school have taught me the importance of having good work habits, strong organizational skills, and strong time management skills. My work experience
has helped me develop my oral communication skills, teamwork skills, professionalism, and ability to work well under pressure. Now I am eager to apply
what I have learned both in school and in my work to a challenging, dynamic, and teamwork-oriented role.

Currently, I am working as a Data Engineer at Jarvis Consulting Group. At Jarvis, I am expanding my skill set by exercising
agile development methods and periodically learning new technology. More specifically, I have been working with my team
in an Agile/Scrum development cycle and have developed applications with Linux, PostgreSQL, and Java.
I have a passion for writing clean, efficient, and high-quality code, and I hope that my work at Jarvis shows that.

What excites me about software development is the limitless potential. I can create anything I want or can think of–from trivial applications like a music
downloader, to a large-scale, graphical operating system with millions of lines of code like Windows. I can turn any small idea I have into potentially the next
Twitter, Facebook, or YouTube; the only thing limiting me as a software developer is my own creativity and drive.

What I also like is the challenge and growth: there are countless programming languages, frameworks, and other development tools available to use, and I am fairly
certain that I could not learn them all even in an entire lifetime. While this may seem daunting, it also means that I will never be left without an opportunity to
grow; there will always be something I can learn and develop my expertise with, and that challenge drives me to push on.

I sincerely hope that the skills, pasion, and work shown here make you want to learn more about me. If so, I look forward to speaking with you.

# List of Jarvis projects

    description: Developed a Linux Cluster Monitoring Agent (LCMA) that is used to record hardware specifications and resource usage (e.g. CPU/Memory) in real-time.
    It is used by the Jarvis Linux Cluster Administration for a Linux cluster of nodes/servers running CentOS 7. Crontab triggers are used to collect data from the
    host machine every minute, which is then stored in a Relational Database Management System database using PostgreSQL (PSQL). Bash scripts are used to create,
    stop, and start the PSQL Docker instance for data collection. SQL queries are used to analyze and present the collected data; they can find the average memory
    a node uses over a time interval and detect server failures.
  - name: "Core Java Apps"

    description:
      - "Twitter App: Not Started"
      - "JDBC App: Developed a a customer-order-processing system programmed in Java. It is connected to a PostgreSQL (PSQL) database that runs inside a Docker
      container. Java Database Connectivity (JDBC) is used to connect the application with the database. JDBC is also used to allow the user to run queries and
      perform all 4 CRUD (create, read, update, and delete) operations on the database. The database contains basic sales information, which includes customers,
      orders, salespeople, and products." PSQL was used to create, populate, and query the database; Maven to compile and build the project and manage its build
      dependencies; a Docker container for deploying the database; and DBeaver for database testing and verification.
      - "Grep App: Developed an application to replicate the Linux `grep` command, which recurively searches for a specified text pattern in files in a
      given directory and outputs matched lines to a file. Maven was used to package the application into a JAR file. A Docker image of the application was made
      and is available on Docker Hub."

    algorithm to learn after every game against either a human or another agent.
  - name: "Learning Management System"
    description: Developed a web application with HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Node.js, Vue.js for Queen’s University’s drama and music department, which is made up of
    80+ staff. Allows users to build an annual list of course offerings, track instructor teaching history and administrative service, calculate workload, and
    update/modify the database. A year-long project that involved group work, design and code review meetings, delivery of complete software specification and
    design, and applying the waterfall process to plan, manage, and track the project. Required frequent communication with the customer and supervisor through
    progress updates, oral presentations, and formal meetings.
